      <description>AlhamduliLlah!
Everybody is writing tutorials and books on programming. Does the world need yet another?
Of course it does. So here I am with mine. But more seriously, the proof is always in the pudding. What I wish to accomplish is to make it so simple as to leave no stone leave unturned. But that can be boring, so at the same time, the challenge fairy tells me I must make the tutorial as interesting and useful as possible within the range of possibility.</description>

      <description>﷽
And what a blessing to be a Moslem! For the temorary hours of life we live on this planet are but temporary, and in the end, death comes to us all, whether we believe or not.
But someone who is not a Moslem will probably wonder where we derive our conviction from? We are thus drawn back to Descartes who asks: but that which I know, how well do I know what I know to be true?</description>

      <description>I divide my life so far into three periods. The golden period, the dreamy period, and the period of reality. In the golden period, I was a professor of mathematics, social and natural sciences at a prestigious university in East Asia. In the dreamy period, I stopped teaching and entered the land of programming. The teacher and the programmer are still a part of me, even though I have entered the stage of reality.</description>

      <description>﷽
We will now directly proceed.
Why is Julia beautiful? Suppose I want to write a &amp;ldquo;verb&amp;rdquo;, which we call a function in programming, that returns (gives us) a greeting. In Julia, this is how we do it:
function greetbot()  return &amp;#34;how do you do?&amp;#34; end So, function is a reserved keyword that is used to construction a procedure in Julia. The name greetbot I chose can be anything that is clear and suitable to the task.</description>

      <description>﷽
Beyond childhood, youth, and the associated tribulations, I divide my life so far into three periods. The golden period, the dreamy period, and the period of reality.
In the golden period, which lasted nearly 15 years, I was a professor of mathematics, social and natural sciences at several universities in East Asia.
In the dreamy period, I stopped teaching and entered the land of programming. The teacher and the programmer are still a part of me, even though I have entered the stage of reality.</description>

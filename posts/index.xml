And what a blessing to be a Moslem! For the temorary hours of life we live on this planet are but temporary, and in the end, death comes to us all, whether we believe or not.
But someone who is not a Moslem will probably wonder where we derive our conviction from? We are thus drawn back to Descartes who asks: but that which I know, how well do I know what I know to be true?</description>

<p>And what a blessing to be a Moslem! For the temorary hours of life we live on this planet are but temporary, and in the end, death comes to us all, whether we believe or not.</p>
<p>But someone who is not a Moslem will probably wonder where we derive our conviction from? We are thus drawn back to Descartes who asks: but that which I know, how well do I know what I know to be true?</p>
<p>After all, it is rational to make sure what a person believes is the best possible choice out of all available ones. For if we look closely, we see conviction in the Hindu who &ldquo;worships&rdquo; his various animals, in the Buddhists, in the neo-Christians and their &ldquo;trinity&rdquo;, even in the pagans who hold various superstitious beliefs, or idolators and and their idols.</p>
<p>Seeing is one thing, feeling is another though.</p>
<p>But before I proceed, I would like to say I do not mean to disrespect anyone or their beliefs. Religion is a personal choice. Here then, my analysis is for my own self. I want to demonstrate that what I believe is the Ultimate Truth, and since there are so many different kinds of beliefs and religions (and cults), I have to use logical analysis of the contrastive type.</p>
<p>So if we see someone having a conviction, it does not automatically follow that there is truth behind such a conviction. The sad stories of Jonestown and Heaven&rsquo;s Gate mass suicides offer conclusive proof that the people who took their lives did so because of the strength of their convictions. But the fundamental question is unanswered: how did those pitiful humans who took their lives in these mass suicides know for sure that their belief system was a true one?</p>
<p>Descartes helps us once again when he asserts that if something is so true that it allows no space for doubt, it will no longer be needed to be proven. Since two plus two is four, disagreement has been lifted from this, making it an axiomatic truth: a truth that is beyond doubt, beyond discussion, beyond any further dispute; it is the final word.</p>
<p>If the mass suicide cults were really telling the truth, it should have been effortless for them to recruit more people than they already had. The truth does not need to be difficult to understand; on the contrary, understanding and truth are on the same plane of thought.</p>
<p>But they didn&rsquo;t or more precisely, they couldn&rsquo;t. At any point in time, psychologically vulnerable people, people suffering from various maladjustments exist who can be easily swayed into an irrational system and stay in it until, either they recover and leave, or something tragic happens. This explains why Jim Jones could entice at least some people to his so-called cause.</p>
<p>By this argument, it might appear then, that all other religions (except Islam) should lead to the Ultimate Truth because we find many adherents for each religion. The popularity of Hinduism or Sikhism in India, for instance, appears on the surface, to satisfy Cartesian requirements as to leaving no more room for doubt.</p>
<p>Or do they?</p>
<p>A contender will throw at us this: if Hinduism is not the truth, then how come so many Indians believe in it? A thousand people might be psychologically vulnerable to fall for Jim Jones, but millions and across centuries?</p>
<p>We will respond to our contester with the help of Mawlawi Balkhi (aka Rumi), who wrote that the desire to seek the Beloved Creator is ingrained in the bossom of every human being, and that is why wherever you see humans you also see religions and religious ceremonies.</p>
<p>Indeed, in the jungles of Amazon, the wild tribes who have never had any &ldquo;civilization&rdquo; reach them are practising their own version of religion. The Aztects, the Mayans, the ancient Egyptians&ndash;we could go on. Even the atheists subsribe to various superstitious views (this was confirmed by a recent study).</p>
<p>So now we are back to square one. Which religion is the one leading to the Ultimate Truth? A rational method of inquiry would be to make a comparative analysis: what does each religion say and what are its rules? And on the basis of this, armed with pure rationality and a healthy dose of skepticism, one could reach the answer by elimination.</p>
<p>For instance, our Christian fellow humans living in modern times claim that the (prophet) Jesus peace and glory be upon him is &ldquo;both the son and the father&rdquo; and a discussion I had with a zealous Christian let me know that &ldquo;Jesus (PBUH) died for our sins&rdquo;. As a person who values critical thinking and has a normally-functioning brain, modern Christianity cannot answer why our Creator Almighty should need a family (namely, a son, or a father!), nor why should anyone die or suffer for someone else&rsquo;s &ldquo;sins&rdquo;.</p>
<p>These two problems are symptomatic of many contradictions and logical fallacies found in the modern-day Bible (not the original one, which we Moslems also hld as sacred as our Noble Book, the Sacred Quran).  A casual reading of the modern Bible reveals many such inconsistencies and the style of writing resembles a book by several different people, and almost nothing of the true original has remained.</p>
<p>But Judaism and Christianity are Abrahamic religions, of which Islam is the last and final one. Thus, according to Islamic teachings, when Christianity emerged, Jews should have converted to Christianity because the original Judaism was corrupted (like the new Christianity now), and when Islam emerged, Christians were supposed to convert to Islam.</p>
<p>So on this account, the original Judaism, Christianity and our Islam are one and the same since they are all the same Monotheistic religions by the very same God Almighty. Of these three, I scratch the previous two as having been &ldquo;expired&rdquo; and now have Islam to contrast against other major religions.</p>
<p>This brings me to Hinduism, Sikhism, Buddhism and other various isms. We will tackle the first two, since they have many adherents. According to <a href="https://www.learnreligions.com">https://www.learnreligions.com</a>:</p>
<pre tabindex="0"><code>Sikhism is the fifth-largest religion in the world. The Sikh religion is also one of the newest and has only been in existence for about 500 years. About 25 million Sikhs are living around the world. 
</code></pre><p>Interesting. And further it goes:</p>
<pre tabindex="0"><code>Sikhism began around 1500 A.D, in the northern part of ancient Punjab, which is now part of Pakistan. It originated   with the teachings of Guru Nanak who rejected the philosophies of the Hindu society that he grew up in. Refusing to   participate in Hindu rites, he argued against the caste system and preached equality of humanity. Denouncing the   worship of demigods and goddesses, Nanak became a traveling minstrel. Going from village to village, he sang in praise of one God.     
</code></pre><p>Okay, so it seems Guru Nanak is more rational than Hindus. Shall we delve deeper? Just to make sure we are on the right path?  The same website reports:</p>
<pre tabindex="0"><code>Sikhs believe in one creator inseparable from creation. Part and participle of one another, the creator exists within creation pervading and permeating every aspect of all that is. The creator watches over and cares for creation. The way to experience God is through creation and by meditating inwardly on the divine character of the manifest self which is in tune with the unmanifest and illimitable, creative infinity known to Sikhs as Ik Onkar.  
</code></pre><p>Aha. Getting more interesting. Sounds very Islamic, at least part of it does. But it also sounds Taoist. The ancient Chinese philosopher, Zhuangzi, who was a Taoist, had similar things to say although he did not mention a Creator; he instead had mentioned &ldquo;The Way&rdquo;.</p>
<p>The Taoist texts are too ancient to remain reliable. Either the language has been misunderstood or mistranslated&ndash;for, ancient Chinese is a completely different language than modern one&ndash;or, the later Taoists had probably created confusing additions that obscured the original teachings. More on this later.</p>
<p>So, Sikhs sound pretty rational. But:</p>
<pre tabindex="0"><code>Sikhism’s Holy Scripture is known formally as Siri Guru Granth Sahib. The Granth is a volume of text containing 1430 Ang (parts or pages) of poetic verse written in raag, the classic Indian system of 31 musical measures. Guru Granth Sahib is compiled from the writings of Sikh Gurus, Hindus, and Muslims. 
</code></pre><p>Ah, &ldquo;compiled from the writings of Sikh Gurus, Hindus, and Muslims&rdquo; in other words, the religion is not original. Guru disagrees with Hindus then takes some of their teachings in their holy book. And of course, just like the Taoists, the gurus seem (somewhat) suspiciously Islamic&ndash;well, because they take the ideas from Islam!</p>
<p>In this manner, I studied and compared many religious beliefs and eventually, one or all of the following occurred:</p>
<ul>
<li>The religion in question imploded due to contradiction</li>
<li>The religion seemed like a plagiarized copy of Islam mixed with some strange elements (like Taoism)</li>
<li>The religion was incompatible with human nature (Buddhism)</li>
<li>The religion did not feel authentic: there was no Holy Book, or if there was, it did felt as if a human had written it.</li>
</ul>
<p>This reduced me to two choices. Either do not believe anything at all, or believe in Islam. The former did not make sense, because I can ask &ldquo;why&rdquo;? If I can ask why I am alive, then there must be a reason for it&ndash;or else I could not have asked why. But even if you ignore this, by pure logic, if we see a book, then somebody must have written it. and our DNA is simply a book&ndash;a code&ndash;that has been written.</p>
<p>Recent advances in biology and genetics already prove, in the Cartesian and axiomatic fashion (that is, beyond doubt), that it is a mathematical (probabilistic) impossibility that our DNA could have been arranged the way it is on its own, due to randomness. All life is, therefore, <em>information</em>, and this information has been written. This cancels atheism.</p>
<p>But what does Islam say?</p>
<p>And if you open our <a href="https://islamawakened.com/quran/17/st75.htm">Noble Book</a>, a random page say, and you read something like this (in fact, for this essay, I did exactly this and this is what I found!):</p>
<blockquote>
<p>17:1  Glory be to He (Allah) Who took His devotee (Muhammad) for a journey by night from the sacred Masjid (at Makkah) to the farthest Masjid (Al-Aqsa at Jerusalem), which We have blessed around it (vicinity), to show him (Muhammad) some of Our signs. Surely, He is the All-Hearer, the All-Seer.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Praise be to Allah, the Most Benevolent, the Most Merciful! But how can I say this and how do I know that form of address is correct? This sacred verse teaches me that this is how I should address my Creator Almighty, who does not need any praise or anything from anyone, but that it is for my own good manners and for calming my own heart; for, when I say these words, a calmness and serenity enters my heart that I cannot account for.</p>
<p>And my Lord of the Worlds teaches me that if I too devote my heart and soul to my Creator, that the reward of my devotion will be some Sign from my Creator.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>17:2  And We gave Moses the Scripture and made it a guide for the children of Israel (saying): “Don’t take other than Me as protector.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>And my Lord (SAA&ndash;meaning <em>Subhan o Allahe el Azeem</em>: Pure is my Creator, the Greatest) teaches us by retelling what happened to the children of Israel, as a lesson, and to directly tell us that except him (genderless, but translated him due to the translation from Arabic&ndash;more on this on Youtube)  there is no protector for us.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>17:3  (You are) offspring of those whom We carried (in the ship) with Noah. Surely, he was a grateful devotee.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Teaching us to be grateful in a similar manner, since we were also carried in our mothers&rsquo; wombs. That we should realize that we coming into this world is a blessing (hence, one reason for praising our Lord), for we were nothing and we did not know that we were nothing&ndash;and we came to be, through our Creator (SAA).</p>
<blockquote>
<p>17:4  And We decreed for the children of Israel in the Scripture: indeed you will do mischief in the earth twice, indeed you will become tyrants, and extremely arrogant! 17:5  When the promise for the first of the 2 came, We sent against you servants of Ours (the Assyrians) who gave a terrible warfare. They entered the very innermost parts of your homes and the promise was fulfilled. 17:6  Then We gave you a return of victory over them, helped you with wealth and children, and granted you more manpower. 17:7  (We said) if you did good, you did good for yourselves; but if you did evil, it was for your own selves. Then, when the last (2nd) promise came to pass, (We permitted your enemies – the Romans) to disgrace your faces and to enter the Masjid (of Jerusalem) just as they had entered it 1st time, and they destroyed all that they had conquered (fell in their hands) with complete destruction.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>That we are taught the value of goodness and its benefit being solely for our own selves, and through the historical reference, to the punishment that can be given to the unjust and the evil, even in this world.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>17:8  It may be that your Lord may show Mercy to you; but if you return (to sins), We shall return (to Our Punishment). And Allah has made hell a prison for the disbelievers.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>That there are two types of punishment, one in this world and one, eternal, called Hell, for those who disbelieve. And the disbelief is closely connected to arrogance and tyranny, for the person who does not willfully believe in the face of overwhelming evidence is doing so because he can&rsquo;t part ways with his own evil deeds.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>17:9  Surely, this Qur’an guides to the way which is just perfect and gives the glad tidings to the believers who do righteous deeds so that they shall have a great reward;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Alhamdulillah! (Glory and Praise to Allah SAA), in the midst of this sacred verse, there is a direct message for us, telling us this Noble book is perfect, and further there are glad tidings for those who believe and do good&ndash;you see how the belief is connected to the righteous deeds? That Allah SAA is Just&ndash;good deed will be rewarded.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>17:10  and those who don’t believe in the Hereafter; We have prepared for them a painful punishment.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>That those who hurt others or themselves by being unjust will not be left unpunished. An Italian man once told me he found the &ldquo;idea&rdquo; of Hell terrifying and he could not sleep because of it. He had chosen not to believe at all, hoping he would avoid it altogether. But there is no avoidance if you are unjust! How many times this noble verse has been a source of solace to me when I have seen injustices I could do nothing about?</p>
<p>For instance, when I saw (by chance) the videos of East Asians beating stray cats to death, or throwing food laced with poison for stray dogs, or how the Vietnamese, for instance, are butchering thousands of dogs each year&hellip;. When I was myself subjected to various cruelties by various people who only looked human but had no humanity left in them, my solace was this promise of painful Hell for them.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>17:11  And mankind invokes (Allah) for evil as mankind invokes (Allah) for good, and mankind is ever hasty.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>That there are sacred verses that, while historical, can also have concurrent meanings. For this specific sacred verse, the scholar Maududi explains:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre tabindex="0" style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;"><code class="language-HTML" data-lang="HTML"><span style="display:flex;"><span>This is in answer to the foolish demands of the disbelievers of Makkah who repeatedly demanded from the Prophet (peace be upon him) to bring about that torment with which he threatened them. It is closely connected with the preceding verse, as if to say: O foolish people instead of asking goodness you demand the torment. Can’t you realize the sufferings of the community which was visited by God’s torment? It also contains a subtle warning to those Muslims who prayed for punishment for those disbelievers who persecuted them and rejected the message obdurately; there were still among those disbelievers many such people who afterwards embraced Islam and became its standard bearers in the world. That is why Allah says: Man does so because he is very hasty and impatient. He prays to Allah for all such things as are the immediate need of the time, though often subsequent experience shows that if Allah had granted his prayer, it would have been very harmful to him. 
</span></span></code></pre></div><blockquote>
<p>17:12  And We have made the night and the day as 2 signs. Then, We have covered the night with darkness and have given light to the day so that you may seek Bounty from your Lord, and that you may compute number of the years and the reckoning. Thus We have explained everything with full explanation.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This is an indication for the compatibility of science and Islam, while also stressing that science (whose language is mathematics) is only a full explanation of everything in existence. (And is not a belief system unto itself, as someone one had once told me: &ldquo;I believe in Science!&rdquo;)</p>
<p>I will now leave the rest of this noble sura (chapter) for you to decode for yourself and feel the impact and the power that is found in them! Anyone with a thinking brain cannot but recognize the Ultimate Truth and Authority of these verses:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>17:13  And We have fastened the deeds of every human in its neck, and on the Day of Resurrection We shall bring out for him a book which will be wide open.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>17:14  (It will be said): “Read your book. You yourself are sufficient today as a reckoner (accountant) against you.”</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>17:15  Whoever goes right, then it goes right only for its own self. Whoever goes astray, then it goes astray only against its own self. No one shall bear the burden of another (on the Day of Judgment). And We don’t punish (in this world) until We have sent a Messenger.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>17:16  And when We decide to destroy a town, We first send commandments to its wealthy luxurious people, but they transgress in it. Thus the word (of punishment) is justified against it. Then We destroy it with complete destruction.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>17:17  And how many generations We have destroyed since after Noah? Your Lord is Sufficient as an All-Knower and All-Seer of the sins of His servants.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>17:18  Whoever wishes for the quick-passing (enjoyment of this world), We quickly grant it to whoever He wills. Then, We condemn him to hell who will burn therein disgraced and rejected</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>17:19  And whoever desires the Hereafter and strives for it with its striving while he is a believer, then they are such that their striving will be appreciated.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>17:20  We provide each of these and those from the Bounties of your Lord. The Bounties of your Lord can never be forbidden.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>17:21  See how We prefer some of them over others and surely, the Hereafter will be greater in degrees and greater in preference.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>17:22  Don’t set up another one worthy of worship with Allah, lest you sit down condemned, forsaken.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>17:23  And your Lord has decreed that you worship none except Him. You shall be good (dutiful) to parents. If one of them or both of them attain old age with you, then don’t say to them a word of disrespect, nor scold them but address them in terms of honor.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>17:24  And lower to them the wing of submission (humility) through Mercy, and say: “My Lord! Bestow on them Your Mercy just as they raised me (when I was) a little child.”</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>17:25  Your Lord knows best what is in your hearts. If you are righteous, then surely, He is forgiving to those who often turn (to Him).</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>17:26  Give to your relatives their due and to the poor, and to the wayfarers. But don’t spend wastefully (your wealth like a spendthrift),</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>17:27  surely, the spendthrifts are brothers of the devils, and the devil is ever ungrateful to its Lord.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>17:28  And if you (O Muhammad) turn away from them (kinsman, poor, wayfarer, etc) seeking a Mercy from your Lord which you hope, then say kind word to them.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>17:29  And you shall neither tie your hands (like a miser) to your neck nor stretch them to their utmost reach, so that you become blameworthy, and in severe poverty.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>17:30  Surely, your Lord extends the provision to whom He wills and straitens (for whom He wills). Surely, He is All-Knower, All-Seer of His servants.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>17:31  And don’t kill your children for fear of poverty. We provide (sustenance) for them and for you. Surely, killing them is a great sin.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>17:32  Don’t approach adultery. Surely, it is a great sin, and it is the worst way.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>17:33  Don’t kill a soul which Allah has forbidden, except for a just cause. And whoever is killed wrongfully, and then surely We have made for its heir (guardian) an authority. But let him not exceed limits in killing (should not kill except the killer only). Surely, he is helped (by Islamic law).</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>17:34  And don’t go near the property of the orphan except with what is best (to improve), until it attains the age of full strength. Fulfill the covenant. Surely! The covenant is a responsibility (will be questioned).</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>17:35  And give full measure when you measure, and weigh with a straight balance. That is good and better interpretation (in the end).</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>17:36  And don’t follow (anyone blindly in matters) about which you don’t have knowledge. Surely, the (use of) hearing, the sight, and the heart - for each of these, you will be questioned (by Allah on the Day of Judgment).</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>17:37  And don’t walk on the earth with arrogance. Surely, you can neither penetrate the earth nor can attain the height of the mountains.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>17:38  All that is evil are hateful to your Lord.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>17:39  This is part of wisdom which your Lord has revealed to you (Muhammad). Don’t set up with Allah another one worthy of worship lest you should be thrown into hell, blameworthy and rejected.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>17:40  Has your Lord preferred for you (O pagans of Makkah) to give sons and adapted (for Himself) from among the angels as females (daughters)? Surely! You utter awful statement.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>17:41  And surely, We have explained in this Qur’an so that they (disbelievers) may take heed, but it has only increased their dislike.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>17:42  Say (O Muhammad to polytheists): “If there were other one worthy of worship besides Him as they say, they would have certainly sought a way to (dethrone) the Master of the Throne.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>17:43  Glorified and exalted is He! (He) is far above (the great falsehood) that they say!</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>17:44  The 7 heavens, the earth, and all that is in them glorify Him. There is not a single thing but glorifies Him with praise. But you don’t understand their glorification. Surely, He is Forbearing, Forgiving.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>17:45  And when you (Muhammad) recite the Qur’an, We make an invisible veil (unseen barrier) between you and between those who don’t believe in the Hereafter.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>17:46  And We put coverings over their hearts so that they don’t understand it (the Qur’an), and create deafness in their ears. When you mention of your Lord alone in the Qur’an, they turn their backs in extreme dislike.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>17:47  We know best what they like to listen when they listen to you. When they take secret counsel, then the wrongdoers say: “You follow none but a bewitched man.”</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>17:48  See how they have put forward examples for you. They have gone astray, and they can not find a way.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>17:49  And they say: “When we are reduced to bones and fragments (ashes), shall we really be resurrected to a new creation?”</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>17:50  Say (O Muhammad):“(You will be brought back to life) even if you be stones or iron,</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>17:51  or even a creation that is greater (or harder) than you may think of.” Then they will ask: “Who will return us (back to life)?” Say: “He Who created you first time.” Then they will shake their heads at you and ask: “When it will be?” Say: “Perhaps it is near (soon)!”</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>17:52  On the Day when He will call you, you will answer with His Praise, and you will think that you have stayed (in death) but a little while!</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>17:53  And say to My servants (true believers) that they should only say those words that are the best. Surely, Satan sows (disagreements) among them. Surely, Satan is a plain enemy to mankind.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>17:54  Your Lord knows you best. If He wills, He will have Mercy on you, or if He wills, He will punish you. And We have not sent you (Muhammad) as a guardian over them.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>17:55  And your Lord knows best all those that are in the heavens and the earth. Indeed, We have preferred some of the prophets above others, and We gave the Psalms to David.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>17:56  Say (O Muhammad): “Call to those whom you pretend (to be worthy of worship) besides Him. They have neither the power to remove the hardship from you nor even to change it.”</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>17:57  Those to whom they pray, desire the means of access to their Lord, which of them should be the nearest, and they hope for His Mercy and fear Hiss punishment. Surely, the punishment of your Lord is (something to be) afraid of.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>17:58  There is not a town but We shall destroy it before the Day of Resurrection, or punish it with severe punishment. That is written in the book (of records).</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>17:59  And nothing stops Us to send the signs but that the people of old denied them. And We sent the she-camel to Thamud as a clear sign, but they did her wrong. And We don’t send the signs except to warn.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>17:60  And (remember) when We said to you (O Muhammad): “Surely! Your Lord has encompassed mankind.” And We have not make the vision (Al-Isra) which We showed you (O Muhammad on the night of Al-Isra) but a trial for mankind, and likewise the accursed tree (Zaqqoom) in the Qur’an. We warn them but it does not increase (fear in) them except great disbelief, oppression and disobedience.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>17:61  And (remember) when We said to the angels: “Prostrate unto Adam.” They prostrated except Satan. He said: “Shall I prostrate to one whom You have created (from) clay?”</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>17:62  (Satan) said: “Is this the one whom You have honored above me? If You give me respite (keep alive) to the Day of Resurrection, I will surely seize and mislead his (Adam’s) offspring (sending them astray) all but a few!”</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>17:63  (Allah) said: “Go, and whoever of them follows you, then surely, hell will be the recompense of all of you, an ample recompense.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>17:64  And befool whom you can of them with your voice, and make assaults on them with your cavalry and your infantry, and share with them in wealth and children, and promise them. But Satan promises them nothing but deception.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>17:65  Surely! My servants, there is no authority for you over them. Your Lord is All-Sufficient as a Guardian.”</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>17:66  Your Lord is the one who drives your ships in the sea in order that you may seek His Bounty. Surely! He is Merciful towards you.</p>

<p>17:67  And whenever any harm touches you at the sea, all those to whom you call upon except Him (Allah) vanish. Yet, when He brings you safely to the land, you turn away (from Him). And human is ever ungrateful.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>17:68  Do you then feel secure that He will not cause side of the land to swallow you up, or send against you a violent sand-storm? Then, you shall not find a guardian for you.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>17:69  Or do you feel secure that when you will return to it (sea) a 2nd time, He will not send a hurricane of wind against you and drown you because of your disbelief? (If that happens) then you will not find for you therein an avenger (to take revenge) against Us.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>17:70  And indeed, We have honored the children of Adam, We have carried them on land and sea, have provided them with good things, and have preferred them over many of those whom We have created with a marked preference.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>17:71  (Remember) the Day when We shall call all human beings with their leaders. Those who will be given their book (of records) in their right hand will read their records and will not be dealt unjustly in the least.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>17:72  But those who are blind (acted) in this world will be blind in the Hereafter and more astray from the way.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>17:73  Surely, they were about to tempt you (O Muhammad) away from that which We have revealed (the Qur’an) to you, to fabricate something other than it against Us, and (if successful) then they would have certainly taken you a friend!</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>17:74  And had We not made you stand firm, surely you would nearly have inclined to (compromise with) them a little bit.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>17:75  Then We would have made you taste a double punishment in this life and a double punishment after death. Then you would not have found anyone to help you against Us.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>17:76  And surely, they were about to frighten you so that they might drive you out from the land. But then they would not have stayed after you, except a little while.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>17:77  (This was Our) way with whom indeed We sent Messengers before you (O Muhammad), and you will not find any alteration in Our Way.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>17:78  Establish prayer from mid-day till the darkness of the night (Zuhr, Asr, Maghrib, and Isha prayers), and (recite the) Qur’an in the early dawn (the morning prayer- Fajr). Surely, the recitation of the Qur’an in the early dawn is witnessed (by angels).</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>17:79  And in (some parts of) the night perform the night prayer with it (recite the Qur’an) as an additional prayer (Tahajjud) for you (O Muhammad). It may be that your Lord will raise you to ‘Maqam-e-Mahmood’ (a station of praise-worthy on the Day of Resurrection).</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>17:80  And say (O Muhammad): “My Lord! Make me enter (the city of Madinah) one entry in truth, and bring me out (from the city of Makkah) one exit in truth. And grant me from You an authority helper,”</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>17:81  and say: “Truth has come and the falsehood has vanished. Surely! Falsehood is bound to vanish.”</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>17:82  And We have sent down the Qur’an which is a healing and a Mercy to the believers, while it increases nothing but loss to the wrongdoers.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>17:83  And when We bestow Our Grace on mankind, it turns away and becomes far away at one side (from the Right Way). When evil touches, it is in great despair.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>17:84  Say (O Muhammad to mankind): “Everyone acts according to its manner; but your Lord knows best whose way (religion) is best guided.”</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>17:85  And they ask you (O Muhammad) about the soul (spirit). Say: “The soul is one of the commands of my Lord and you have not been given the knowledge of it but a little.”</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>17:86  And if We willed, We could surely take away all that which We have revealed to you (this Qur’an). Then you would find no protector for you against Us (to get it back),</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>17:87  except as a Mercy from your Lord. Surely! His Grace to you (O Muhammad) is great indeed.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>17:88  Say: “If the mankind and the jinns together were to bring the like of this Qur’an, they could not bring the like thereof, even if some of them was helper to some others.”</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>17:89  And indeed We have fully explained to mankind in this Qur’an every kind of similitude, but most people refuse but disbelief.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>17:90  And they say: “We shall not believe in you (O Muhammad) until you cause a spring to gush forth from the earth for us,</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>17:91  or there is a garden of date-palms and grapes for you and cause rivers to gush forth in their midst abundantly;</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>17:92  or you cause to fall the heaven upon us in pieces as you have claimed, or you bring Allah and the angels (face to face) before us,</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>17:93  or there is a house of adorable materials (like silver and gold) for you, or you ascend up into the sky, and we shall not believe in your ascension until you bring down for us a book that we would read.” Say (O Muhammad): “Glory be to my Lord! Am I (claimed) anything more but a human, sent as a Messenger?”</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>17:94  And nothing prevented people from belief when the guidance came to them except that they said: “Has Allah sent a human as (His) Messenger?”</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>17:95  Say: “If there were angels walking on the earth in peace, then We would certainly have sent down to them an angel from the heaven as a Messenger.”</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>17:96  Say: “Allah is sufficient as a witness between me and between you. Surely! He is All-Knower, the All-Seer of His servants.”</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>17:97  And those whom Allah guides are rightly guided; but those whom He sends astray, they will never find protectors for them besides Him. We shall gather them on the Day of Resurrection on their faces, blind, dumb and deaf. Their abode will be hell; whenever its flame abates, We shall increase the fierceness of fire for them.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>17:98  That is their recompense because they denied Our Verses and they said: “When we are reduced to bones and fragments, shall we really be resurrected as new creation?”</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>17:99  They don’t see that Allah, who has created the heavens and the earth, is able to create the people like them. He has made for them an appointed term; there is no doubt in it. But the wrongdoers refuse but disbelief.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>17:100  Say (to the disbelievers): “Even if you possessed all the treasures of the Mercy of my Lord, you would surely hold them back for fear of spending. Human is ever miserly!”</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>17:101  And indeed We gave to Moses 9 clear signs. Ask the children of Israel, when he came to them, then Pharaoh said to him: “O Moses! I think you are indeed bewitched.”</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>17:102  (Moses) replied: “Surely, you know that no one has sent down these signs but the Lord of the heavens and the earth as clear signs. Surely O Pharaoh, I think you are doomed to destruction.”</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>17:103  So he (Pharaoh) wanted to turn them out of the land (of Egypt). But We drowned him and all who were with him.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>17:104  And We said to the children of Israel after him: “You reside in the land and then when the last promise comes, We shall assemble you as a mixed crowd.”</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>17:105  And We have sent it (the Qur’an) down with truth and with truth it has descended. And We have not sent you (O Muhammad) except as a bearer of glad-tidings and a Warner.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>17:106  And We have divided the Qur’an (into parts) so that you may recite it to people at intervals. And We have revealed it by stages (in 23 years).</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>17:107  Say (O Muhammad to them): “Whether you believe in it (the Qur’an) or don’t believe, surely those who were given knowledge before it (Jews and Christians like Abdullah bin Salam and Salman Al-Farsi), they fall down on their faces in prostration when it is recited to them,</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>17:108  and they say: ‘Glory be to our Lord! Surely, the Promise of our Lord must be fulfilled.’</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>17:109  And they fall down on their faces, weeping and it increases their humility.”</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>17:110  Say (O Muhammad): “Invoke Allah or invoke the Beneficent, by whatever name you invoke Him, to Him belongs the best names. Offer your prayer neither aloud nor make it in a low voice but seek a way between these</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>17:111  and say: “Praise be to Allah, Who has not taken a son, and Who has no partner in (His) Dominion, nor there is any protector for Him out of dependence. And magnify Him with all magnificence.</p>
